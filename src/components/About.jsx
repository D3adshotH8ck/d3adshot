                <p>
                    I'm a passionate developer and security enthusiast driven by the challenge of building secure, resilient digital experiences. My journey started with web development, crafting responsive interfaces with <span className="highlight">React</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This led me down the rabbit hole of cybersecurity, where I now specialize in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities. I thrive on the process of ethical hacking—from network reconnaissance to exploiting complex web application flaws—to helping fortify digital defenses.
